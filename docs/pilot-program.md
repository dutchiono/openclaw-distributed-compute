# OpenClaw Distributed Compute - Community Pilot Program

**Program Name:** OpenClaw Compute Alpha Network
**Timeline:** Q2 2026 (12 weeks)
**Target:** 1,000 active nodes contributing 4,000+ petaFLOPS
**Goal:** Validate technical architecture, build community, prepare for public beta

---

## Program Overview

The Alpha Network is a closed pilot program to test the OpenClaw Distributed Compute infrastructure with trusted community members before public launch. Participants will run early versions of the agent software, contribute compute resources, and provide feedback on the experience.

**Why a Pilot Program?**
- Test protocol under real-world conditions with diverse hardware
- Identify and fix bugs before public launch
- Build community champions who understand the vision
- Generate case studies and success stories
- Validate economic model (credit system, pricing)

## Program Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Objectives:**
- Deploy control plane infrastructure (scheduler, registry, API)
- Release agent software alpha (invitation-only)
- Onboard first 100 nodes
- Execute first distributed compute jobs

**Success Metrics:**
- 100+ active nodes (uptime > 80%)
- 10+ jobs completed successfully
- < 5% task failure rate

### Phase 2: Scale (Weeks 5-8)

**Objectives:**
- Scale to 500 nodes
- Add diverse workload types (rendering, simulations)
- Optimize scheduler performance
- Implement credit system

**Success Metrics:**
- 500+ active nodes
- 100+ jobs completed
- < 3% task failure rate

### Phase 3: Refine (Weeks 9-12)

**Objectives:**
- Reach 1,000 nodes
- Stress test infrastructure
- Security audit and hardening
- Prepare documentation for public beta

**Success Metrics:**
- 1,000+ active nodes
- 500+ jobs completed (total program)
- 99%+ job completion rate
- Security audit passed
- 90%+ participant satisfaction
